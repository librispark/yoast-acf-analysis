WordPress plugin that adds the content of all ACF fields to the Yoast SEO score analysis.

== Description ==
[Yoast WordPress SEO's](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/) score analysis does not take in to account the content of a post's [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). This plugin uses Yoast WordPress SEO 3.1's plugin system to hook into the analyser in order to add ACF content to the SEO analysis.

This had previously been done by the [WordPress SEO ACF Content Analysis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seo-acf-content-analysis/) plugin but that no longer works with Yoast 3.0. Kudos to [ryuheixys](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ryuheixys/), the author of that plugin, for the original idea.

This Plugin is compatible with the free ACF 4 Version as well as with the PRO Version 5. Please be aware that it ignores Pro Add-Ons for Version 4. In that case please upgrade to ACF PRO Version 5.
